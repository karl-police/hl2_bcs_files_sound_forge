# Batch Job Files made through the ``.bcs`` files from Half-Life 2

If you stumbled here through Google while looking for what these ``.bcs`` file are and how to open them. Then yes, this Repository is exactly what you think it is.

This is an export from **Sonic Foundry Batch Converter** ``.bcs`` format to **SOUND FORGE Pro 12** ``.bj``

You can use these files inside SOUND FORGE applications.

## Conversion

The files were manually converted. I used to do it once, but from visually. Later I learned more about how Computers work, so I copy pasted HEX values onto the files.

While some ``.bcs`` Plugins don't match the newer ones, the _"HEX copy paste"_ method, didn't work on all well, luckily it wasn't any _"Analog gambling-guessing"_ values,
so I could easily match it exactly to the original ones.
